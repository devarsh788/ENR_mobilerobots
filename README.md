We have created a prototype of an obstacle-avoiding differential drive robot that moves from one place to another based on the coordinates(local) entered. The robot moves on the X-Y, where X-axis and Y-axis coordinates need to be entered. Afterwards, the programed arduino calculates the amount of degrees it needs to turn to reach the desired point. With the help of the gyroscope aligns itself.
Float x and float y are the input parameters for the x and y coordinates and the float timeNeeded is to set to adjust the speed of the robot.
